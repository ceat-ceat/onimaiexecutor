this will work as long as you have serverside access

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceat-ceat/onimaiexecutor/main/client/main.lua", true))()
```

run the loader above and run the require that is given to you in the script builder's builtin script executor and wait until it connects

you can add an autorun by editing `onimai_autoexec.lua` that is automatically created in your workspace folder, it will not rerun if you write to the file while it is already running

supports `krnl`

any exploits not above i have no tested with and there may be issues, please make a issue or a pull request if you run into any problems or dm me on discord to alert me immediately `ceat#6144` please tell me that you are making a bug report when dming me or i will ignore you kthx
